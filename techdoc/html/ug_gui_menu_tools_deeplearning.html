The typical workflow consists of two parts:
<ul>
<li>network training</li>
<li>image prediction</li>
</ul>
During network training users specify type of the
network architecture (the <em>Network panel</em> of Deep MIB) and provide images and ground truth
models (the <em>Directories and Preprocessing tab</em>). For training, the provided data will be split into two sets: one set to be
used for the actual training (normally it contains most of the ground truth data)
and another for validation. The network trains itself over the training
set, while checking own performance using the validation set (the
<em>Training tab</em>).
<br>
The pretrained network is saved to disk and can be distributed to predict (the <em>Predict tab</em>) unseen
datasets.<br>
Please refer to the documentation below for details of various
options available in MIB.

</p><h2 id="3">Directories and Preprocessing tab</h2><p>This tab allows choosing directories with images for training and prediction as well as various preprocessing parameters. During preprocessing the images and model files are processed and converted to a mibImg format that is used for training and prediction. However, in some situations, preprocessing step can be omitted. In this case, DeepMIB will used with original image files (see below for details).</p><p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="images\DeepLearning_FileTree.jpg" alt=""> </p><p>
Image files used in DeepMIB workflows can be arranged in 3 different ways:
<ul>
<li><b>Preprocessing mode</b>, this mode is enabled when
<b>Preprocess for: <em>Training and prediction</em></b> option is
selected. This mode is recommended for the general use. The scheme below
demonstrates organization of directories compatible with this mode. For
the legend see a figure below.<br><br>
<img src = "images\DeepLearningDirectories_A.png">
</li>
<li>
<b>Without preprocessing, when datasets are manually split into training
and validation sets</b>, the modes without preprocessing may be
beneficial in situations when the input patch size of the network is
matching the image size in files. This option is suitable, when the files
were manually split into the training and validation sets.
<img src = "images\DeepLearningDirectories_B.png">
</li>
<li>
<b>Without preprocessing, with automatic splitting of datasets into training and validation sets</b>,
the modes without preprocessing may be
beneficial in situations when the input patch size of the network is
matching the image size in files. In this mode, the files are randomly
split into the train and validation sets. The split is done upon press of
the <em>Preprocess</em> button, when <b>Preprocess for: <em>Split for training and validation</em></b>
<img src = "images\DeepLearningDirectories_C.png">
</li>
</ul>
<img src = "images\DeepLearningDirectories_Legend.png">
<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><b>Directory with images and models for training</b> [<em>used
only for training</em>]:<br>
use these widgets to select directory that contain images and model to be
used for training. For the organization of directories see the schemes above.<br>
For 2D networks the files should contain individual 2D images, while for 3D networks
individual 3D datasets.<br>
The <em><b>extension</b></em> dropdown menu on the right-hand side can be used to specify extension
of the image files. The <b><em>Bio</b></em> checkbox toggles standard or
Bio-format readers for reading the images. If the Bio-Format file is a collection of image, the <em>Index</em> edit box can be used
to specify an index of the file within the container<br><br>
<ul><b>Important notes:</b><br><br>
<li>Number of model or mask files should match the number of image files
(with one exception for 2D networks, where it is allowed to have a single
model file in MIB *.model format, when <b>Single MIB model file:
ticked</b>)</li>
<li>For models in standard image formats it is important to
specify number of classes including the Exterior into the <b>Number of
classes</b> edit box</li>
<li><b><em>Important! It is not possible to use numbers as names of
materials, please name materials in a sensible way!</b></em></li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>Tip!</b> if you have only one segmented dataset you can split it into
several datasets using <em>Menu->File->Chopped images->Export</em>
operation.
<br><br>
<br>
<li><b>Directory with images for prediction</b><br>
use these widgets to specify directory with images for prediction (in the schemes above <em>2_Prediction</em>). The
image files should be placed under <em>Images</em> subfolder. Optionally,
when the ground truth models for prediction images is available, it can
be placed under <em>Labels</em> subfolder.
<br>
When the preprocessing mode is used the images from this folder are
converted and saved to <em>3_Results\Prediction images</em> directory.
<br>For 2D networks the files should contain individual 2D images, while for 3D networks
individual 3D datasets.
<br><br>
When the ground truth models are present, they are also processed and copied to
<em>3_Results\PredictionImages\GroundTruthLabels</em>. These models can
be used for evaluation of results (see the <em>Predict</em> tab
below for details).<br>
The <em><b>extension</b></em> dropdown menu on the right-hand side can be used to specify extension
of the image files. The <em>Bio</em> checkbox toggles standard or
Bio-format readers for reading the images.<br><br>
</li>
<li><b>Single MIB model file checkbox</b>, (<em>only for 2D
networks</em>) tick it, when using a single model file with
segmentations</li>
<li><b>Model extension dropdown</b>, (<em>only for 2D
networks</em>) is used to select extension of files containing models.
For 3D network MIB model format is used.</li>
<li><b>Number of classes edit box</b>, (<em>TIF or PNG formats only</em>)
is used to define number of classes (including Exterior) in models. For
model files in MIB *.model format, this field is not used.</li>
<li><b>Use masking checkbox</b> is used when some parts of the training
data should be excluded from training. The masks may be provided in various formats
and number of mask files should match the number of image files.
<br>
<b>Note!</b> masking may give drop in precision of training due to
inconsistency within the image patches.</li>
<li><b>Mask extension</b> is used to select extension for files that
contain masks. For 3D network only MIB *.mask format is supported</li>
<li><b>Directory with resulting images</b><br>
use these widgets to specify the main output directory; results and all
preprocessed images are stored there.
<br> All subfolders inside this
directory are automatically created by Deep MIB:<br><br>
<b>Details of directories (see also the Legend figure above)<br></b>
<ul>
<li><em>PredictionImages</em>, place for the prepocessed images for
prediction</li>
<li><em>PredictionImages\GroundTruthLabels</em>, place for ground truth models
for prediction images, when available</li>
<li><em>PredictionImages\ResultsModels</em>, the main outout directory with generated models after prediction.
The 2D models can be combined in MIB by selecting the files using the Shift+left mouse click during loading</li>
<li><em>PredictionImages\ResultsScores</em>, folder for generated prediction scores (probability) for each material.
The score values are scaled between 0 and 255</li>
<li><em>ScoreNetwork</em>, for accuracy and loss score plots, when the <em>Export training plots</em> option
of the <em>Train</em> tab is ticked and for storing checkpoints of the network after each epoch,
when the <em>Save progress after each epoch</em> checkbox is ticked</li>
<li><em>TrainImages</em>, images to be used for training (<em>only for preprocessing mode</em>)</li>
<li><em>TrainLabels</em>, models accompanying images to be used for training (<em>only for preprocessing mode</em>)</li>
<li><em>ValidationImages</em>, images to be used for validation during training (<em>only for preprocessing mode</em>)</li>
<li><em>ValidationLabels</em>, models accompanying images for validation (<em>only for preprocessing mode</em>)</li>
<br>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Compress processed images checkbox</b>, tick to compress the processed images.
The processed images are stored in <em>*.mibImg</em> format that can be loaded in MIB.
<em>*.mibImg</em> is a variation of standard Matlab format and can also be directly loaded into Matlab
using similar to this command: <em>res = load('img01.mibImg, '-mat');</em>.
<br>
Compression of images slows down performance!</li>
<li><b>Compress processed models</b>, tick to compress models during preprocessing.
The processed models are stored in <em>*.mibCat</em> format that can be loaded in MIB (<em>Menu->Models->Load model</em>).
It is a variation of a standard Matlab format, where the model is encoded using categorical class of Matlab.
<br>
Compression of models slows down performance but brings significant benefit of small file sizes</li>
<li><b>Use parallel processing</b>, when ticked DeepMIB is using multiple
cores to process images. Number of cores can be specified using the
<b>Workers</b> edit box. The parallel processing during preprocessing
operation brings significant decrease in time required for
preprocessing.</li>
<li><b>Fraction of images for validation</b>, define fraction of images
that will be randomly (<b>Random generator seed</b>) assigned into
the validation set. When set to 0, the validation option will not be used during the training</li>
<li><b>Random generator seed</b>, number to initialize random seed
generator, which defines how the images for training and validation are
split. For reproducibility of tests keep value fixed</li>
<li><b>Preprocess for</b>, select mode of operation upon press of the <b>Preprocess</b> button.
Results of the preprocessing operation for each mode are presented in schemes above</li>
</ul>
<br>
</p><h2 id="4">Train tab</h2><p>This tab contains settings for generating deep convolutional network and training. Before processing further please finish the preprocessing part, see above.</p><p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="images\DeepLearningTrain.png" alt=""> </p><p>
Before starting the training process it is important to check and if needed modify
the settings. Also, use the <em>Network filename</em> button
in the <em>Network</em> panel to select filename for the resulting network.
<ul>
<li><b>Input patch size</b>, this is important field that has to be defined
based on available memory of GPU, dimensions of the training dataset and
number of color channels.<br>
The patch size defines dimensions of a single image block that will be
directed into the network for training. The dimensions are always
defined with 4 numbers representing height, width, depth, colors of the
image patch (for example, type "572 572 1 2" to specify a 2D patch of
572x572 pixels, 1 z-slice and 2 color channels).<br>
The patches are taken randomly from the volume/image and number of those
patches can be specified in the <b>Patches per image</b> field.
</li>
<li><b>Padding</b> defines type of the convolution padding, depending on
the selected padding the <em>Input patch size</em> may have to be adjusted.
<ul>
<li><b><em>same</em></b> - zero padding is applied to the inputs to convolution
layers such that the output and input feature maps are the same size</li>
<li><b><em>valid</em></b> - zero padding is not applied to the inputs to
convolution layers. The convolution layer returns only values of the convolution
that are computed without zero padding. The output feature map is smaller
than the input feature map.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Number of classes</b> - number of materials of the model including Exterior, specified as a positive number</li>
<li><b>Encoder depth</b> - number of encoding and decoding layers of the
network. U-Net is composed of an encoder subnetwork and a corresponding decoder subnetwork.
The depth of these networks determines the number of times the input image is
downsampled or upsampled during processing. The encoder network downsamples
the input image by a factor of 2^D, where D is the value of EncoderDepth.
The decoder network upsamples the encoder network output by a factor of 2^D.</li>
<li><b>Patches per image</b> - specifies number of patches that will be taken
from each an image or a 3D dataset. According to our experience, the best strategy is to take
1 patch per image and train network for larger number of epochs. When taking a single patch per image
it is important to set <em>Training settings (Training button)->Shuffling->every-epoch</em>).
However, fill free to use any sensible number</li>
<li><b>Mini Batch Size</b> - number of patches processed at the same time by the network.
More patches speed up the process, but it is important to understand that the
resulting loss is averaged for the whole mini-batch. Number of mini batches depends on amount of GPU memory</li>
<li><b>Filters</b> - number of output channels for the
first encoder stage, <em>i.e.</em> number of convolitional filters used to process the input image patch during the first stage.
In each subsequent encoder stage, the number of output channels doubles.
The unetLayers function sets the number of output channels in each decoder
stage to match the number in the corresponding encoder stage</li>
<li><b>Filter size</b> - convolutional layer filter size; typical values are in the range [3, 7]</li>
<li><b>Activation layer</b> - specifies type of the activation layers of
the network. When the layer may have additional options, a settings
button on the right-hand side becomes available.
<ul>
<li><em>reluLayer</em> - <a href="https://se.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/ref/nnet.cnn.layer.relulayer.html">
Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) layer</a>, it is a default activation layer of the networks,

triggered. When the augmentation is defined with 2 values, the first value specifies whether it is on (==1) or off (==0),
alternatively, the first two values define the variation range, a random
number will be picked between these numbers and used as the parameter for
the filter. Each specific augmentation may be turned off either by setting its probability (the last value) to 0
or by setting its variation range to be as shown in the "off=[x,x,x]" text<br>
The 2D augmentation settings can be reset to default by
pressing <em>Options tab->Reset 2D augmentation button</em><br>

% The typical workflow consists of two parts: 
% <ul>
% <li>network training</li>
% <li>image prediction</li>
% </ul>
% During network training users specify type of the
% network architecture (the <em>Network panel</em> of Deep MIB) and provide images and ground truth
% models (the <em>Directories and Preprocessing tab</em>). For training, the provided data will be split into two sets: one set to be 
% used for the actual training (normally it contains most of the ground truth data)
% and another for validation. The network trains itself over the training
% set, while checking own performance using the validation set (the
% <em>Training tab</em>). 
% <br>
% The pretrained network is saved to disk and can be distributed to predict (the <em>Predict tab</em>) unseen
% datasets.<br>

% <ul>
% <li><b>Input patch size</b>, this is important field that has to be defined 
% based on available memory of GPU, dimensions of the training dataset and 
% number of color channels.<br>
% The patch size defines dimensions of a single image block that will be

% defined with 4 numbers representing height, width, depth, colors of the
% image patch (for example, type "572 572 1 2" to specify a 2D patch of
% 572x572 pixels, 1 z-slice and 2 color channels).<br>
% The patches are taken randomly from the volume/image and number of those
% patches can be specified in the <b>Patches per image</b> field.
% </li>
% <li><b>Padding</b> defines type of the convolution padding, depending on
% the selected padding the <em>Input patch size</em> may have to be adjusted.
% <ul>
% <li><b><em>same</em></b> - zero padding is applied to the inputs to convolution 
% layers such that the output and input feature maps are the same size</li>
% <li><b><em>valid</em></b> - zero padding is not applied to the inputs to 
% convolution layers. The convolution layer returns only values of the convolution 
% that are computed without zero padding. The output feature map is smaller 
% than the input feature map.</li>

% <li><b>Patches per image</b> - specifies number of patches that will be taken 
% from each an image or a 3D dataset. According to our experience, the best strategy is to take
% 1 patch per image and train network for larger number of epochs. When taking a single patch per image
% it is important to set <em>Training settings (Training button)->Shuffling->every-epoch</em>).
