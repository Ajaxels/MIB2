%
% * Added materials with 65535 maximal number of materials
% * Added export to Excel for non-PC platforms via <https://se.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/38591-xlwrite--generate-xls-x--files-without-excel-on-mac-linux-win xlwrite: Generate XLS(X) files without Excel on Mac/Linux/Win>
% * Added automatic mode for interpolation of images shown in the Image
% View panel. When magnification is 100% or higher MIB is using the nearest
% method, otherwise bicubic
% * Added Median3D filter to the Image Filters panel (R2017a and newer)
% * Added to the Statistics dialog generation of new models, where each object has its own index
% * Added running average correction to the Alignment tool
% * Added find and select material under the mouse cursor using the Ctrl+F shortcut
% * Added pasting of selection to all layers (Menu->Selection->Selection to buffer->Paste to all slices (Ctrl+Shift+V)
% * Added indication of material index under the mouse cursor to the |Pixel info| of the |Path panel|
% * Added possibility to save models for MIB version 1 (File->Models->Save model as...->MATLAB format for MIB ver. 1 (*.mat))
% * Modified use of Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V, now the stored dataset can be pasted to
% any other dataset in MIB assuming that the dataset have the same
% width/height. As result |storedSelection| property of |mibImage| class has been
% moved to |mibModel| class
% * Fixed export of models and masks to another MIB dataset for the compiled version
% * Fixed singleton running of MIB, now it is possible to have several
% instances of MIB run in parallel

%
% * Added selection of the model type to Menu->Models->Type and removed it
% from the Preferences dialog
% * Added 'Recalculate selected measurements' function to the Measure tool
% to recalculate distances and image intensities
% * Added possibility to exclude black or white intensities when using the
% contrast normalizaton of Z-stacks (Menu->Image->Contrast->Normalize layers->Z stack)
% * Added imresize3 function to resample datasets with R2017a (40-50% faster)
% * Added calculation of annotation labels occurrence in the Stereology tool
% * Moved mibView.disableSegmentation to mibModel.disableSegmentation

%
% [dtls][smry] *2.00 / 20.03.2017 Official Release, 2.002 (02.04.2017)* [/smry]
%
% * With release 2.0 MIB has been rewritten to utilize Controller-View-Model
% architecture, which brings stability and ease of future development.
% However, because of that, the system requirements for MATLAB were increased
% and MIB2 is only available for MATLAB R2014b and older 
% (due to continuous development of MATLAB, the most recent release is always recommended)
% * Added "Copy to clipboard" and "Open directory in the file explorer" for the right mouse button
% click over the current path edit box of the path panel (ver. 2.002)
% * Added adaptive black and white thresholding
% * Many other improvements
% * Added offset shift for the rechop mode (ver. 2.001)
% * Renamed Area to Volume for the Get Statistics tool for 3D objects (ver. 2.002)
% * Big fixes (ver. 2.001, 2.002)
