%% 1. Multiple buffer buttons
% These buttons allow fast access to several datasets stored in the memory. The green color of the button indicates that
% there is a dataset loaded. When cursor is above the button a tooltip with the full file name appears to help with
% identification of the loaded dataset. The datasets may be switched using the left mouse button press on the desired button.
% The left mouse button shows a popup menu with additional options:

% 
%%
% 
% * *Duplicate dataset*, creates a duplicate of the currently shown dataset
% and put it behind one of the available buffers
% * *Sync view, (xy) with...*, synchronizes the view with another dataset in the XY
% coordinates
% * *Sync view, (xyz) with...*, synchronizes the view with another dataset in the
% XYZ coordinates, for 4D-5D datasets
% * *Sync view, (xyzt) with...*, synchronizes the view with another dataset in the
% XYZT coordinates, for 5D datasets
% * *Clear dataset*, removes selected dataset from the memory
% * *Clear all stored datasets*, removes all stored datasets from the memory
% 
%% 2. Main list box
% The major part of the panel is occupied with this list box that shows
% list of files in the selected directory (the directory can be selected from the <ug_panel_path.html Path Panel>). 
% The files are filtered with the specified filter (*Filter*). Value |all known| displays all readable formats.
%%
% 
% * Double click on a file, loads it into |MIB| and displays it in the
% <ug_panel_im_view.html Image View panel>. If |sequence| (*8*) is checked then all shown files
% are assembled into a single multi-layered dataset
% * Double click on the *[.]* line changes the folder to the top level of the current
% logical drive
% * Double click on the *[..]* line changes the folder to one level up
% * Individual datasets can be selected using |Shift/Ctrl + left mouse
% button|  and loaded via a context menu accessible with the right mouse button
% * The right mouse click above the scroll bar will scroll the list to the
% top
% * The context menu is accessible with the right mouse button:

%% 5. Left Interchangeable Panels
% Selected panel will be shown in the lower left part of |MIB|
%
% * <ug_panel_segm.html Segmentation panel>
% * <ug_panel_roi.html ROI panel>
% 
%% 6. Right Interchangeable Panels
% Selected panel will be shown in the right bottom part of |MIB|.

%% 7. Bio checkbox
% |MIB| can also open some specific biological image
% formats. Usually these are the native file formats for different
% microscopes. The reader for these formats is obtained from 
% <http://openmicroscopy.org/info/bio-formats Bio-formats>
% and is based on connected to |MIB| Bio-formats Java library (the library is stored in the 
% |mib\ImportExportTools\BioFormats| directory). When the |Bio| checkbox is selected the 
% Bio-formats reader is called to select desired datasets.
