1. Introduction.

This software library implements the maxflow algorithm
described in

	An Experimental Comparison of Min-Cut/Max-Flow Algorithms
	for Energy Minimization in Vision.
	Yuri Boykov and Vladimir Kolmogorov.
	In IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (PAMI), 
	September 2004

This algorithm was developed by Yuri Boykov and Vladimir Kolmogorov
at Siemens Corporate Research. To make it available for public use,
it was later reimplemented by Vladimir Kolmogorov based on open publications.

If you use this software for research purposes, you should cite
the aforementioned paper in any resulting publication.

Tested under windows, Visual C++ 6.0 compiler and unix (SunOS 5.8
and RedHat Linux 7.0, GNU c++ compiler).
