-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The HistThresh Toolbox contains selected histogram-based thresholding
algorithms for MATLAB. The toolbox has been originally developed with
MATLAB 6.5 (R13).


CURRENT VERSION
---------------

v1.03 (13 Feb 2013)
- fixed problem with never entering the loop in th_maxlik.m
- fixed problem with finding the minimum between the peaks in th_minimum.m


INSTALLATION
------------

Extract the contents of the zip file "HistThresh.zip" into a directory
from which MATLAB can find the m-files.


GETTING STARTED
---------------

The thresholding algorithms are named with the prefix "th_". For
example, "th_minimum.m" is the function for the algorithm by Prewitt
and Mendelsohn that chooses the threshold to be in the valley of a
bimodal histogram. The threshold for an 8-bit image can be found by
typing "T = th_minimum(I)". Further help can be obtained by typing
"help <m-file>" in MATLAB, where "<m-file>" is replaced by the name of
an m-file.
