<body>
Indexing and coordinate mapping between IMOD and Matlab<br>
<br>
MRC Image structures typically index fastest along rows, then along
columns and finally along planes (or sections)<br>
- is the row indexing from left to right or right to left<br>
- is the column indexing from top to bottom or bottom to top<br>
<br>
<br>
IMOD models specify the center of the voxel with Matlab indices
(1, 1, 1) as a point at (0.5, 0.5, 0.0)<br>
